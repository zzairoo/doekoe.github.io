The app stores players and match results in `localStorage` by default. If Supabase is configured, friends can join the same shared room with a room name and password.

Advanced mode calculates payouts from matches: choose winners, losers, the stake, and who each winner receives from.

## Supabase setup

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Open the Supabase SQL editor.
3. Run the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
5. Fill in `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from Supabase project settings.
6. Restart `npm run dev`.

The room password is hashed in the browser before being sent to Supabase. The database table is not directly readable by the anonymous key; access goes through the `join_room` and `save_room_data` functions.
